<|SENTENCE|> well then returned don quixote to my mind it is you who are the one that is out of his wits and enchanted as you have ventured to utter such blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and accepted as true that whoever denies it as you do deserves the same punishment which you say you inflict on the books that irritate you when you read them for to try to persuade anybody that amadis and all the other knightsadventurers with whom the books are filled never existed would be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not yield light or ice cold or earth nourishment what wit in the world can persuade another that the story of the princess floripes and guy of burgundy is not true or that of fierabras and the bridge of mantible which happened in the time of charlemagne for by all that is good it is as true as that it is daylight now and if it be a lie it must be a lie too that there was a hector or achilles or trojan war or twelve peers of france or arthur of england who still lives changed into a raven and is unceasingly looked for in his kingdom one might just as well try to make out that the history of guarino mezquino or of the quest of the holy grail is false or that the loves of tristram and the queen yseult are apocryphal as well as those of guinevere and lancelot when there are persons who can almost remember having seen the dame quintañona who was the best cupbearer in great britain and so true is this that i recollect a grandmother of mine on the fathers side whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood used to say to me grandson that one is like dame quintañona from which i conclude that she must have known her or at least had managed to see some portrait of her then who can deny that the story of pierres and the fair magalona is true when even to this day may be seen in the kings armoury the pin with which the valiant pierres guided the wooden horse he rode through the air and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a cart and alongside of the pin is babiecas saddle and at roncesvalles there is rolands horn as large as a large beam whence we may infer that there were twelve peers and a pierres and a cid and other knights like them of the sort people commonly call adventurers or perhaps i shall be told too that there was no such knighterrant as the valiant lusitanian juan de merlo who went to burgundy and in the city of arras fought with the famous lord of charny mosen pierres by name and afterwards in the city of basle with mosen enrique de remesten coming out of both encounters covered with fame and honour or adventures and challenges achieved and delivered also in burgundy by the valiant spaniards pedro barba and gutierre quixada of whose family i come in the direct male line when they vanquished the sons of the count of san polo i shall be told too that don fernando de guevara did not go in quest of adventures to germany where he engaged in combat with micer george a knight of the house of the duke of austria i shall be told that the jousts of suero de quiñones him of the paso and the emprise of mosen luis de falces against the castilian knight don gonzalo de guzman were mere mockeries as well as many other achievements of christian knights of these and foreign realms which are so authentic and true that i repeat he who denies them must be totally wanting in reason and good sense <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> they grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen then bertram devere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair geraldine he saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a carriage and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three miles because you understand the carriage was all smashed up i found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because i had no experience to go by i asked ruby gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because i thought shed likely be an authority on the subject having so many sisters married ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when malcolm andres proposed to her sister susan she said malcolm told susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said what do you say darling pet if we get hitched this fall and susan said yesnoi dont knowlet me seeand there they were engaged as quick as that but i didnt think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one so in the end i had to imagine it out as well as i could i made it very flowery and poetical and bertram went on his knees although ruby gillis says it isnt done nowadays geraldine accepted him in a speech a page long i can tell you i took a lot of trouble with that speech i rewrote it five times and i look upon it as my masterpiece bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace and told her they would go to europe for a wedding tour for he was immensely wealthy but then alas shadows began to darken over their path cordelia was secretly in love with bertram herself and when geraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious especially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring all her affection for geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she should never marry bertram but she pretended to be geraldines friend the same as ever one evening they were standing on the bridge over a rushing turbulent stream and cordelia thinking they were alone pushed geraldine over the brink with a wild mocking ha ha ha but bertram saw it all and he at once plunged into the current exclaiming i will save thee my peerless geraldine but alas he had forgotten he couldnt swim and they were both drowned clasped in each others arms their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards they were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing diana its so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding as for cordelia she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum i thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> i believe it replied the duenna from your worships gentle and winning presence only such a christian answer could be expected the fact is then señor don quixote that though you see me seated in this chair here in the middle of the kingdom of aragon and in the attire of a despised outcast duenna i am from the asturias of oviedo and of a family with which many of the best of the province are connected by blood but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents who i know not how were unseasonably reduced to poverty brought me to the court of madrid where as a provision and to avoid greater misfortunes my parents placed me as seamstress in the service of a lady of quality and i would have you know that for hemming and sewing i have never been surpassed by any all my life my parents left me in service and returned to their own country and a few years later went no doubt to heaven for they were excellent good catholic christians i was left an orphan with nothing but the miserable wages and trifling presents that are given to servants of my sort in palaces but about this time without any encouragement on my part one of the esquires of the household fell in love with me a man somewhat advanced in years fullbearded and personable and above all as good a gentleman as the king himself for he came of a mountain stock we did not carry on our loves with such secrecy but that they came to the knowledge of my lady and she not to have any fuss about it had us married with the full sanction of the holy mother roman catholic church of which marriage a daughter was born to put an end to my good fortune if i had any not that i died in childbirth for i passed through it safely and in due season but because shortly afterwards my husband died of a certain shock he received and had i time to tell you of it i know your worship would be surprised and here she began to weep bitterly and said pardon me señor don quixote if i am unable to control myself for every time i think of my unfortunate husband my eyes fill up with tears god bless me with what an air of dignity he used to carry my lady behind him on a stout mule as black as jet for in those days they did not use coaches or chairs as they say they do now and ladies rode behind their squires this much at least i cannot help telling you that you may observe the good breeding and punctiliousness of my worthy husband as he was turning into the calle de santiago in madrid which is rather narrow one of the alcaldes of the court with two alguacils before him was coming out of it and as soon as my good squire saw him he wheeled his mule about and made as if he would turn and accompany him my lady who was riding behind him said to him in a low voice what are you about you sneak dont you see that i am here the alcalde like a polite man pulled up his horse and said to him proceed señor for it is i rather who ought to accompany my lady doña casildafor that was my mistresss name still my husband cap in hand persisted in trying to accompany the alcalde and seeing this my lady filled with rage and vexation pulled out a big pin or i rather think a bodkin out of her needlecase and drove it into his back with such force that my husband gave a loud yell and writhing fell to the ground with his lady her two lacqueys ran to rise her up and the alcalde and the alguacils did the same the guadalajara gate was all in commotioni mean the idlers congregated there my mistress came back on foot and my husband hurried away to a barbers shop protesting that he was run right through the guts the courtesy of my husband was noised abroad to such an extent that the boys gave him no peace in the street and on this account and because he was somewhat shortsighted my lady dismissed him and it was chagrin at this i am convinced beyond a doubt that brought on his death i was left a helpless widow with a daughter on my hands growing up in beauty like the seafoam at length however as i had the character of being an excellent needlewoman my lady the duchess then lately married to my lord the duke offered to take me with her to this kingdom of aragon and my daughter also and here as time went by my daughter grew up and with her all the graces in the world she sings like a lark dances quick as thought foots it like a gipsy reads and writes like a schoolmaster and does sums like a miser of her neatness i say nothing for the running water is not purer and her age is now if my memory serves me sixteen years five months and three days one more or less to come to the point the son of a very rich farmer living in a village of my lord the dukes not very far from here fell in love with this girl of mine and in short how i know not they came together and under the promise of marrying her he made a fool of my daughter and will not keep his word and though my lord the duke is aware of it for i have complained to him not once but many and many a time and entreated him to order the farmer to marry my daughter he turns a deaf ear and will scarcely listen to me the reason being that as the deceivers father is so rich and lends him money and is constantly going security for his debts he does not like to offend or annoy him in any way now señor i want your worship to take it upon yourself to redress this wrong either by entreaty or by arms for by what all the world says you came into it to redress grievances and right wrongs and help the unfortunate let your worship put before you the unprotected condition of my daughter her youth and all the perfections i have said she possesses and before god and on my conscience out of all the damsels my lady has there is not one that comes up to the sole of her shoe and the one they call altisidora and look upon as the boldest and gayest of them put in comparison with my daughter does not come within two leagues of her for i would have you know señor all is not gold that glitters and that same little altisidora has more forwardness than good looks and more impudence than modesty besides being not very sound for she has such a disagreeable breath that one cannot bear to be near her for a moment and even my lady the duchessbut ill hold my tongue for they say that walls have ears <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> and why not mother said sanchica would to god it were today instead of tomorrow even though they were to say when they saw me seated in the coach with my mother see that rubbish that garlicstuffed fellows daughter how she goes stretched at her ease in a coach as if she was a shepope but let them tramp through the mud and let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground bad luck to backbiters all over the world let me go warm and the people may laugh do i say right mother <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> his right hand which seemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy a sign of great strength in its owner lay on the side of his heart but before i could put any question to montesinos he seeing me gazing at the tomb in amazement said to me this is my friend durandarte flower and mirror of the true lovers and valiant knights of his time he is held enchanted here as i myself and many others are by that french enchanter merlin who they say was the devils son but my belief is not that he was the devils son but that he knew as the saying is a point more than the devil how or why he enchanted us no one knows but time will tell and i suspect that time is not far off what i marvel at is that i know it to be as sure as that it is now day that durandarte ended his life in my arms and that after his death i took out his heart with my own hands and indeed it must have weighed more than two pounds for according to naturalists he who has a large heart is more largely endowed with valour than he who has a small one then as this is the case and as the knight did really die how comes it that he now moans and sighs from time to time as if he were still alive <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> excuse me excuse me of course it would be rather difficult for katerina ivanovna to understand but do you know that in paris they have been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the insane simply by logical argument one professor there a scientific man of standing lately dead believed in the possibility of such treatment his idea was that theres nothing really wrong with the physical organism of the insane and that insanity is so to say a logical mistake an error of judgment an incorrect view of things he gradually showed the madman his error and would you believe it they say he was successful but as he made use of douches too how far success was due to that treatment remains uncertain so it seems at least <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> it is a formidable difficulty and i fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solve it the past and the present are within the field of my inquiry but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer mrs stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on several occasions there were three possible courses he might claim the property from south america establish his identity before the british authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to england at all or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that he need be in london or again he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers putting him in as heir and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income we cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulty and now my dear watson we have had some weeks of severe work and for one evening i think we may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels i have a box for _les huguenots_ have you heard the de reszkes might i trouble you then to be ready in half an hour and we can stop at marcinis for a little dinner on the way <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> presently a fox met him whats the matter my friend said he why do you hang down your head and look so lonely and woebegone ah replied the horse justice and avarice never dwell in one house my master has forgotten all that i have done for him so many years and because i can no longer work he has turned me adrift and says unless i become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again what chance can i have of that he knows i have none or he would not talk so <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> well it seems a weary number of hours she muttered doubtfully it must be more i remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled and edgar being cruelly provoking and me running into this room desperate as soon as ever i had barred the door utter blackness overwhelmed me and i fell on the floor i couldnt explain to edgar how certain i felt of having a fit or going raging mad if he persisted in teasing me i had no command of tongue or brain and he did not guess my agony perhaps it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice before i recovered sufficiently to see and hear it began to be dawn and nelly ill tell you what i thought and what has kept recurring and recurring till i feared for my reason i thought as i lay there with my head against that table leg and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window that i was enclosed in the oakpanelled bed at home and my heart ached with some great grief which just waking i could not recollect i pondered and worried myself to discover what it could be and most strangely the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank i did not recall that they had been at all i was a child my father was just buried and my misery arose from the separation that hindley had ordered between me and heathcliff i was laid alone for the first time and rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping i lifted my hand to push the panels aside it struck the tabletop i swept it along the carpet and then memory burst in my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair i cannot say why i felt so wildly wretched it must have been temporary derangement for there is scarcely cause but supposing at twelve years old i had been wrenched from the heights and every early association and my all in all as heathcliff was at that time and been converted at a stroke into mrs linton the lady of thrushcross grange and the wife of a stranger an exile and outcast thenceforth from what had been my world you may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where i grovelled shake your head as you will nelly you have helped to unsettle me you should have spoken to edgar indeed you should and compelled him to leave me quiet oh im burning i wish i were out of doors i wish i were a girl again half savage and hardy and free and laughing at injuries not maddening under them why am i so changed why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words im sure i should be myself were i once among the heather on those hills open the window again wide fasten it open quick why dont you move <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> _cest charmant_ poor relation yes i am in my natural shape for what am i on earth but a poor relation by the way i am listening to you and am rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me for something real not simply your fancy as you persisted in declaring last time <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> that is the truth replied anselmo and relying upon that i will tell thee friend lothario that the desire which harasses me is that of knowing whether my wife camilla is as good and as perfect as i think her to be and i cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point except by testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her virtue as the fire proves that of gold because i am persuaded my friend that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is not tempted and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the promises gifts tears and importunities of earnest lovers for what thanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be bad and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband that will take her life the first time he detects her in an impropriety i do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes out of temptation and trial with a crown of victory and so for these reasons and many others that i could give thee to justify and support the opinion i hold i am desirous that my wife camilla should pass this crisis and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooed and by one worthy to set his affections upon her and if she comes out as i know she will victorious from this struggle i shall look upon my good fortune as unequalled i shall be able to say that the cup of my desire is full and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says who shall find her has fallen to my lot and if the result be the contrary of what i expect in the satisfaction of knowing that i have been right in my opinion i shall bear without complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me and as nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me from carrying it into effect it is my desire friend lothario that thou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this purpose that i am bent upon for i will afford thee opportunities to that end and nothing shall be wanting that i may think necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous honourable modest and highminded woman and among other reasons i am induced to entrust this arduous task to thee by the consideration that if camilla be conquered by thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes but only far enough to account that accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone thus i shall not be wronged in anything more than intention and my wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence which i know well will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me if therefore thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life thou wilt at once engage in this love struggle not lukewarmly nor slothfully but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands and with the loyalty our friendship assures me of <|LABEL|> question <|END|>

<|SENTENCE|> i am not wrong ill show you their pamphlets everything with them is the influence of environment and nothing else their favourite phrase from which it follows that if society is normally organised all crime will cease at once since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant human nature is not taken into account it is excluded its not supposed to exist they dont recognise that humanity developing by a historical living process will become at last a normal society but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant quicker than any living process thats why they instinctively dislike history nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it and they explain it all as stupidity thats why they so dislike the _living_ process of life they dont want a _living soul_ the living soul demands life the soul wont obey the rules of mechanics the soul is an object of suspicion the soul is retrograde but what they want though it smells of death and can be made of indiarubber at least is not alive has no will is servile and wont revolt and it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery the phalanstery is ready indeed but your human nature is not ready for the phalansteryit wants life it hasnt completed its vital process its too soon for the graveyard you cant skip over nature by logic logic presupposes three possibilities but there are millions cut away a million and reduce it all to the question of comfort thats the easiest solution of the problem its seductively clear and you musnt think about it thats the great thing you mustnt think the whole secret of life in two pages of print <|LABEL|> exclamation <|END|>
